# 🚗 Vehicle Detection & Counting Using YOLOv11 + OpenCV

A real-time vehicle detection and counting system built in my **free time** using **YOLOv11** and **OpenCV**, designed to process **video files** and provide live vehicle count analytics.

## 📽️ Demo
This project supports **video input only** (not webcam or images). It detects and counts vehicles crossing user-defined lines in either **UP** or **DOWN** directions.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Detects multiple vehicle types: **Cars, Motorcycles, Buses, Trucks**
- 🧠 Uses **YOLOv11** for accurate object detection
- 🎯 Line-crossing logic to count vehicles moving **up** or **down**
- 🖱️ Mouse-based UI to draw counting zones
- 📊 Annotated output video with real-time stats
- 🧼 Clean and readable Python code
